# BellyButton Biodiversity
## Overview
This project was intended to test our knowledge of HTML and JavaScript's library, plotly. We designed and deployed a website using GitHub Pages focusing on the biodiversity of bacteria that can be found in a subject's bellybutton.
We used a sample dataset in JSON. Given this, the website can not be deployed locally given CORS errors; thus, the website needed to be deployed with the aid of GitHub Pages.
### Tools
- Visual Studio
- JavaScript
- Plotly
- HTML
